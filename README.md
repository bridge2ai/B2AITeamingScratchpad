The goal of shinyB2AIDashboard is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinyB2AIDashboard like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(shinyB2AIDashboard)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## The Bridge2AI Program

The NIH Common Fund’s Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI)
program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for
widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) that tackles complex
biomedical challenges beyond human intuition. A key step in this process
is generating new “flagship” data sets and best practices for machine
learning analysis. Machine learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) that provides machines (like computers) the ability to
automatically learn and improve from experience, without being
explicitly programmed. The biomedical research community generates a
wealth of data, but most of these data are not suitable for machine
learning because they are incomplete. By bringing technological and
biomedical experts together with social scientists and humanists, the
Bridge2AI program will help bring solutions to this deficit by:

- Generating new flagship biomedical and behavioral data sets that are
  ethically sourced, trustworthy, well-defined, and accessible
- Developing software and standards to unify data attributes across
  multiple data sources and across data types
- Creating automated tools to accelerate the creation of FAIR (Findable,
  Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and ethically sourced data
  sets
- Providing resources to disseminate data, ethical principles, tools,
  and best practices
- Creating training materials and activities for workforce development
  that bridges the AI, biomedical, and behavioral research communities
